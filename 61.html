            <div>
                <p class="question">1. What are the major components of the propeller?</p>
                <p class="answer">The major components are the Blades, Hub, Crosshead, Beta Tube Assembly, Pitch Change Cylinder and Piston, Blade Bearings, and Blade Counterweights.</p>

                <p class="answer">The model number is CR408/6-123-F/17. The breakdown is: C: Civil, R: Dowty Aerospace Propellers, 408: Aircraft type identification, 6: Number of blades, 123: Blade root end size in mm, F: Flange mounted, 17: Function / Installation characteristics.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">3. What materials are the propeller blades made of, and what is the propeller's diameter?</p>
                <p class="answer">The propeller has six all-composite blades, and the diameter is 13.5 ft (4.11 m).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">4. How is the propeller's blade pitch changed?</p>
                <p class="answer">Blade pitch is changed using an electronically controlled hydraulic pitch actuation system, which is accomplished by metered oil pressure.</p>

        <div class="section-box" style="background-color: #e9ffe9; border-color: #ccffcc;">
            <h2>Propeller Control and Operation</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="question">1. How is torque transmitted from the engine reduction gearbox to the propeller?</p>
                <p class="answer">Torque is transmitted from the reduction gearbox through three dowels and the friction of the flange interface. The dowels account for approximately 50% of the torque transmission, and the flange friction accounts for the other 50%.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">2. What is the Propeller Electronic Control (PEC), and what does it do?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Propeller Electronic Control (PEC) is a dual-channel, microprocessor-based controller that uses inputs from the aircraft, propeller control system sensors, and the engine control system to control propeller pitch and speed.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">3. What components are electronically connected to the PEC?</p>
                <p class="answer">The PEC is electronically connected to the condition lever, power lever (through FADEC), Magnetic Pick-up Unit (MPU), Beta Feedback Transducer (BFT), Pitch Control Unit (PCU), and the Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">4. What is the function of the Pitch Control Unit (PCU)?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Pitch Control Unit (PCU) is a hydromechanical device that is commanded by the PEC. It meters high-pressure engine oil to a servo valve and controls the flow of oil to the fine or coarse pitch chambers of the propeller to move the blades in the desired direction.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">5. What is the purpose of the Propeller Overspeed Governor Unit?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Propeller Overspeed Governor Unit is an independent mechanical system that protects the propeller from overspeeding.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">6. What is the Auxiliary Feathering Pump Unit used for?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Auxiliary Feathering Pump Unit provides an independent way to feather the propeller if the primary feathering system fails.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <h2>Feathering and Underspeed Protection</h2>
            <div>
                <p class="question">1. What is the Propeller Overspeed Governor Unit and what is its purpose?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Propeller Overspeed Governor Unit is an independent mechanical system that protects the propeller from overspeeding.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">2. What are the three propeller feathering systems mentioned in the document?</p>
                <p class="answer">The propeller feathering systems provide autofeathering, alternate feathering and unfeathering, and manual feathering.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">3. What is the function of the Automatic Underspeed Protection Circuit (AUPC)?</p>
                <p class="answer">The AUPC is a circuit included in the PEC to prevent a catastrophic event in the case of an unsolicited coarse pitch demand due to a software or hardware failure. It sends a "drive fine" signal to the PCU in the event of propeller underspeeding due to a common mode software error, which ensures total aircraft thrust loss does not fall below the thrust of a single engine.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">4. How is the propeller tested on the ground?</p>
                <p class="answer">The OSG can be tested on the ground by operating the PROP O'SPEED GOVERNOR test switch on the Pilots Side Panel on the flight deck.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p class="question">1. What is the Beta Mode?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Beta range is from a power lever position above FLIGHT IDLE to the full reverse (MAX REV) position. When the propeller is in Beta mode, the blade angle is set by the power lever input.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">2. What is the purpose of the Propeller Synchrophasing System?</p>
                <p class="answer">The Propeller Synchrophasing System reduces cabin noise by controlling the relative position, or phase difference, between the slave propeller and the master propeller to a demanded angle.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">3. What happens if the Propeller Overspeed Governor (OSG) fails to control an overspeed condition?</p>
                <p class="answer">If the OSG fails, the FADEC will reduce engine fuel at approximately 1122 Np, which will cause the Np to decrease.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">4. What are the three types of propeller feathering systems mentioned?</p>

            <div>
                <p class="question">5. How is the propeller speed controlled in Reverse Speed Control mode?</p>
                <p class="answer">In this mode, the system operates in a closed-loop propeller RPM control, maintaining the propeller speed between 660 and 950 rpm. The engine schedules fuel based on a power schedule versus the Power Lever Angle (PLA).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="question">6. What is the function of the 'hard' and 'soft' flight fine stops?</p>
                <p class="answer">The hydraulic 'hard' flight fine stop limits the fine pitch in the constant speeding mode to approximately 16Â°. The function of this stop is to maintain a minimum pitch consistent with a positive counterweight effort towards coarse pitch, ensuring the effectiveness of the OSG. A 'soft' stop of approximately 16.5 degrees is programmed into the PEC and is operative while the Power Lever is at or above Flight Idle.</p>
