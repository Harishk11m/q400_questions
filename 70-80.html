    <li>
      <span class="question">What signals the GCU to terminate the output from pin Q, and what happens as a result?</span>
      <p>When the engine reaches 50% Nh, the speed sensor in the starter signals the GCU to terminate the output from pin Q. This removes power from the Start Select switch's hold coil, causing the switch to return to the <strong>OFF</strong> position.</p>
