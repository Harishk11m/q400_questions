        <p class="question">Q136: How is the APU Fire Protection System tested, and what indications occur during the test?</p>
        <p class="answer">A136: To test the APU Fire Protection System, the FIRE TEST push button on the Fire Protection Panel (FPP) is pushed. During the test, the control amplifier performs the following: FIRE (red) light on the FPP, BTL ARM (amber) light on the FPP, FUEL OPEN (green) advisory light on the FPP goes off, FUEL CLOSED (white) light on the FPP comes on, EXTG (white) switch light on the FPP comes on, FAULT (amber) light on the FPP comes on, CHECK FIRE DET (red) warning light on the Caution and Warning Panel (flashes), Master WARNING PRESS TO RESET (red) light on the Glareshield Panel (flashes), and Fire Bell (optional). The shutdown signal to the APU FADEC and the APU fuel shut off valve circuits are also tested and the APU shuts down.</p>

        <p class="question">Q139: Is pilot action required to operate APU fire protection? What automatic actions occur when an APU fire or overheat is sensed?</p>
        <p class="answer">A139: No pilot action is required to operate APU fire protection. When a fire or overheat is sensed, the control amplifier controls a relay which closes the APU fuel valve. The APU is shut down automatically, and the FAIL advisory light on the APU control panel comes on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-pair">
        <p class="question">Q140: What happens after a seven-second delay following a fire or overheat detection in the APU? What indications confirm this action?</p>
        <p class="answer">A140: After a seven-second delay, an electrical signal from the control amplifier ignites an Electro-Explosive Device (EED) in the extinguisher cartridge. The EED explodes, and the fire extinguishing agent is automatically released. The APU BTL ARM light on the FPP goes out, and the BTL LOW light comes on.</p>
